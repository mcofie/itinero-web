# The Art of the Deal

You don't need a trust fund to see the world. With a little flexibility and some insider knowledge, you can stretch your dollar further than you thought possible.

## 1. Shoulder Season is Key

Traveling just before or after peak season (shoulder season) can save you up to 50% on flights and accommodation. The weather is usually still great, and the crowds are thinner.

## 2. Eat Like a Local

Skip the restaurants with English menus out front.
*   **Street Food**: Often safe, delicious, and incredibly cheap.
*   **Local Markets**: Buy fresh ingredients and have a picnic.

## 3. Leverage Points

Start collecting miles and points today. Even a simple cashback card can fund a free flight once a year.
